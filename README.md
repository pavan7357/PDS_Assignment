Principles of Data Science course is one of my favorite subject. As Data Science student and enthusiast, I tend to always have a keen interest towards data. I took this course in my master's in data science at UMKC. PDS will give a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts, techniques, and tools used in the field of data science. This course covers topics such as data manipulation, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining.

This particular repository consists of PDS assignments.
