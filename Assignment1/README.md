Height is measured in inches, Weight in pounds, Age in years, Grip strength in kilograms. Frailty is
qualitative attribute indicated the presence or absence of the symptoms. Based on the following table,
design the three stages of reproducible workflow, includes the work you can do and the folder structure
in each stage (reference study case in chapter 3). (5 points)

2) Perform 5 data visualization tasks on the student performance dataset given in the link below (create
5 different visualizations). Explain what kind analysis has become easier with each of the visualizations.
Create the folder structure for this question similar to question 1. (15 points).
